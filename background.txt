When creating a crossword, there is a predetermined list from which words are typically chosen.
Many longtime crossword creators may choose to cultivate their own lists over several years,
adding in words or phrases that they come across during their day-to-day work. However,
these curated lists rarely take into account cultural diversity and regional history, resulting 
in a more limited list that takes significant manual effort to create.

This project aims to facilitate adding custom context to any crossword list, via the
Spotify and Wikipedia APIs, so that crossword creators can easily create more diverse puzzles.
- Spotify: Link your account and scrape all songs, artists, and even movie titles
- Wikipedia: Look up any Wikipedia page and add all words found on that page

The functions below will return a list of all unique words found. Specify whether to
break up phrases into their respective words (with the option to keep the original phrases as well),
and whether these unique words should be returned concatenated to our default word list (removing
the need for manual editing).
